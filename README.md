* Started exploring the 2018 100k data set due to it being the most up to date and being a smaller size for use with students.

* Ended up using the 1998 100k data set (for most models) due to additional user data, pre feature engineered one hot encoding of the movie genres as well as the smaller sizing for use with students.
